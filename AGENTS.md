# Codex Astro Base Template Instructions

These instructions apply to Codex and other agentic coding tools that read `AGENTS.md`.
They are reusable base instructions for Astro projects.

## First Steps

**READ THE README.md FIRST.** It contains essential documentation about:
- Project structure and file organization
- Component patterns and the `locale` prop system
- i18n system and translation files
- SEO configuration (files marked with `// SEO:` comments)
- ContentForge API integration
- Styling guidelines and Tailwind conventions

## Architecture and Components

- Follow the existing project structure, code style, and component patterns.
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Reuse existing components and styling patterns before introducing new ones.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions, helpers, or dependencies.
- Each component should represent one section focused on a single subject, theme, or customer conversion step.
- Create a separate component whenever a new subject, theme, or conversion step is introduced.
- Do not exceed 150 lines of code per file.
- Refactor as soon as a generated feature would push a file beyond 150 lines of code.

## Tailwind CSS — STRICT RULES

This project uses **Tailwind CSS 4** with strict conventions:

### ✅ ALWAYS: Use Native Tailwind Classes Only

```astro
<div class="flex items-center gap-4 px-6 py-4 text-zinc-100">
<button class="rounded-lg bg-zinc-300 px-4 py-2 hover:bg-zinc-200">
```

### ❌ NEVER: Use Arbitrary Values (Brackets)

```astro
<!-- FORBIDDEN -->
<div class="w-[347px] mt-[23px] text-[#1a2b3c] bg-[rgb(255,0,0)]">
```

### ❌ NEVER: Use Inline Styles

```astro
<!-- FORBIDDEN -->
<div style="margin-top: 23px;">
<div style={{ marginTop: '23px' }}>
```

### Animation Priority Order

1. **First**: Use native Tailwind animations (`animate-pulse`, `animate-spin`, `animate-bounce`)
2. **Second**: Use Tailwind transitions (`transition-colors`, `transition-transform`, `duration-200`)
3. **Last resort only**: Create custom `@keyframes` in `global.css` (only if explicitly requested or Tailwind cannot cover the animation)

```css
/* Only if native Tailwind cannot cover the animation */
@keyframes custom-animation {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```

### If User Requests Non-Standard Styling

Only deviate from these rules if the user **explicitly requests**:
- Arbitrary values for a specific use case
- Custom utility layers or design tokens
- Complex animations requiring keyframes

## SEO and Accessibility

- Preserve responsive behavior and accessibility.
- Every HTML generation must follow the best possible SEO and accessibility practices.
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- Include proper ARIA labels and landmark roles.
- Ensure all interactive elements have focus states.

## i18n Guidelines

- All user-facing text must use translation keys via `getFixedT(locale)`.
- Component and variable names remain in English regardless of content language.
- Translation keys are organized by component name in JSON files.

## Change Safety

- Do not perform large refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Do not overwrite user changes unless explicitly asked to do so.
- Keep existing file structure and naming conventions.
